# pickaxe.me

The main site. I'll start it out as a static blog type thing and see where it
goes from there. That means this is a:

- S3 bucket
- CloudFront Distribution
- Jekyll build configuration
- Site source using a template (what can I say? FE dev isn't my strength)

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bentheax/pickaxe-me-site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bentheax/pickaxe-me-site)

## Licensing

This site is, at this point, heavily derivative of the [Sera Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/sera-onepage-multipurpose-html-template/17600013). Meaning that if you'd like to copy any design elements, you should purchase a license.
